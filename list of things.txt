todo:
ruleset:
disruptor/gauss vehicle weapons, and tank variants.
balancing, check all weapon damage types, play with armour values
ufopedia entries for new weapons
use weapon mount on craft in missions?

code:
fix weapon placements on snakeman, also walking noises.
mission types: STR_ANTI_INFILTRATION STR_MILITARY_DEFENCE
are melee units attacking diagonally? they're REACTING diagonally but this is by no means a definitive answer.
make terror more likely (1/4 UFOs will instead spawn as terror sites?)
make funding nations much harder to please, make them drop out more often, and when they sign a pact, start generating anti-infiltration missions somewhere in their country (use alien base as a template for how to generate a hidden mission) at a rate of about 1.5 per month, and start generating military defence missions every few weeks or so until all anti-infiltration missions are complete, and set the funding nation to "happy" 
sattelite defense network? - extra base with free planet wide hyper-wave decode, quadruple transit times, no possibility for manufacturing facilities, no hangers. - new map

maps:
add HWP factory as terror site
find more maps to use as terror sites.
look into including modified versions of existing maps in the tilesets

to release next version:
maps - all
tanks, cannons, balance.


done:
hovertanks and laser tanks and guardian fighters, oh my!
added Guardian class interceptor (costs more, is better, funky new sprite(when i can touch dogfight code)
tweaked lightning to be actually good
set avenger to have one weapon slot only, hybrid transports don't get to be effective fighter craft too, sorry.
all missing alien races re-implemented, including Chryssalids, and their evil powers.
terror missions at military bases (new map type) with military personnel (new unit type) with flashbangs and all mundane weapon types available
plasma blade (alien combat knife), disruptors (alien laser tech) and gauss guns (alien AP tech) - aliens spawn with them - researchable, manufacturable
flashbangs - explode immediately, no priming, reduces reactions, accuracy and detection radius for 2-3 turns
sped up all projectiles by a factor of 2
heavy weapons will only be issued to soldiers capable of using them (weight > 10, strength > 35)
added police, they will show up as local law enforcement on terror missions and actually fight aliens
