todo:
Cult of Sirius! (rank 8 alien, human cultist, 1 in 6 chance for 3-5 humans)
cultist bases pop up - new mission type: purge - destroy the cultists
cultist attacks on your base.
make a new map type for ground-based assaults, with a 40x40 tile to represent the base compound on a 60x60 map
Training Room for xcom agents using similar rules to X-com apocalypse
Race specific items and Maps EG: Egg sacks for snakeman, clone tanks for sectiods - recover as alien reproduction
research of reproduction leads to new base facility - cloning facility - allows for dead soldiers to be revived with their stats reduced slightly - option to splice with alien DNA to improve psychic defence by x amount at the cost of... strength? health? stamina? all of the above?
New ufo layouts for variety
Inventory screens for all units in game
make aliens pick up weapons if any nearby and none in hand
spawn 10-20 engineers and scientists on base defence missions, faction_neutral,
ruleset:
ufopedia entries for new weapons
use weapon mount on craft in missions?
mission types: STR_ANTI_INFILTRATION STR_MILITARY_DEFENCE
make funding nations much harder to please, make them drop out more often, and when they sign a pact, start generating anti-infiltration missions somewhere in their country (use alien base as a template for how to generate a hidden mission) at a rate of about 1.5 per month, and start generating military defence missions every few weeks or so until all anti-infiltration missions are complete, and set the funding nation to "happy" 
sattelite defense network? - extra base with free planet wide hyper-wave decode, quadruple transit times, no possibility for manufacturing facilities, no hangers. - new map
make lightning into fast-response unit
make tank shells explosive



done:
medical bay and doctors added - decreases convalescence time of wounded units based on the number of doctors on hand (current formula is 15 doctors = double heal rate, 40 doctors = triple, 60+ doctors (requires 2 hospitals) = quadruple)
cloning facility added

researchable disruptor and gauss cannons for hovertanks and crafts
complete armour rework
complete weapon damage workover
hovertank turret placement fixed.
snakemen slither!

set avenger to have one weapon slot only, hybrid transports don't get to be effective fighter craft too, sorry.
all missing alien races re-implemented, including Chryssalids, and their evil powers.
terror missions at military bases (new map type) with military personnel (new unit type) with flashbangs and all mundane weapon types available
plasma blade (alien combat knife), disruptors (alien laser tech) and gauss guns (alien AP tech) - aliens spawn with them - researchable, manufacturable
flashbangs - explode immediately, no priming, reduces reactions, accuracy and detection radius for 2-3 turns
sped up all projectiles by a factor of 2
heavy weapons will only be issued to soldiers capable of using them (weight > 10, strength > 35)
added police, they will show up as local law enforcement on terror missions and actually fight aliens
