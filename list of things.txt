todo:
new tank type - sectopod - recolour of original sprites?
list them as: 
    Reconditioned Sectopod - requires 2 corpses, equipped with disruptor
    Disruptor Sectopod - requires disruptor cannon, elerium and a mess of alloys
    Railgun Sectopod - requires rail cannon, elerium and a mess of alloys
grenade likelihood should be affected by difficulty
alien stats should be affected by difficulty
number of aliens on veteran and genius should be the average of beginner/experienced and superhuman
ufo firing rate decreases by 3 seconds per difficulty level
funding nation withdrawal trigger should be higher on higher levels
aliens will "remember" where you are for an extra turn per difficulty level
aliens get a "free peek" on turn 20 (screw you, yes they do.)
don't impose a limit on the number of live aliens you can HAVE, but check... every hour? to see if the number of
    live aliens exceeds the capacity of the containment facility, and if so, start a "containment breach" mission - 
    arm terrorists, keep the rest unarmed, but make sure the AI prioritizes making them pick up a weapon ASAP - 
    putting general stores near alien containment is a BAD IDEA, keeping live chryssalids is just asking for trouble.
convert captured aliens to fight for you using BRAINWASHING FACILITY (the mere existance of such a facility reduces funding nation's disposition?) - cannot convert terror units, chryssalids would go badly.
Cult of Sirius! (rank 8 alien, human cultist, 1 in 6 chance for 3-5 humans)
cultist bases pop up - new mission type: purge - destroy the cultists
cultist attacks on your base.
make a new map type for ground-based assaults, with a 40x40 tile to represent the base compound on a 60x60 map
Training Room for xcom agents using similar rules to X-com apocalypse
Race specific items and Maps EG: Egg sacks for snakeman, clone tanks for sectiods - recover as alien reproduction
research of reproduction leads to new base facility - cloning facility - allows for dead soldiers to be revived with their stats reduced slightly - option to splice with alien DNA to improve psychic defence by x amount at the cost of... strength? health? stamina? all of the above?
New ufo layouts for variety
Inventory screens for all units in game
make aliens pick up weapons if any nearby and none in hand
spawn 10-20 engineers and scientists on base defence missions, faction_neutral,
ufopedia entries for new weapons
use weapon mount on craft in missions?
mission types: STR_ANTI_INFILTRATION, STR_MILITARY_DEFENCE STR_PURGE, STR_CULTIST_DEFENCE, STR_CULTIST_BASE
make funding nations much harder to please, make them drop out more often, and when they sign a pact, start generating anti-infiltration missions somewhere in their country (use alien base as a template for how to generate a hidden mission) at a rate of about 1.5 per month, and start generating military defence missions every few weeks or so until all anti-infiltration missions are complete, and set the funding nation to "happy" 
sattelite defense network? - extra base with free planet wide hyper-wave decode, quadruple transit times, no possibility for manufacturing facilities, no hangers. - new map
make lightning into fast-response unit
make tank shells explosive



done:
medical bay and doctors added - decreases convalescence time of wounded units based on the number of doctors on hand (current formula is 15 doctors = double heal rate, 40 doctors = triple, 60+ doctors (requires 2 hospitals) = quadruple)
cloning facility added
third map type for terror missions: now has commercial, residential and military base.
researchable disruptor and gauss cannons for hovertanks and crafts
complete armour rework
complete weapon damage workover
hovertank turret placement fixed.
snakemen slither!
hovertanks and laser tanks and guardian fighters, oh my!
added Guardian class interceptor (costs more, is better, funky new sprite(when i can touch dogfight code)
tweaked firestorm to be actually good
set avenger to have one weapon slot only, hybrid transports don't get to be effective fighter craft too, sorry.
all missing alien races re-implemented, including Chryssalids, and their evil powers.
terror missions at military bases (new map type) with military personnel (new unit type) with flashbangs and all mundane weapon types available
plasma blade (alien combat knife), disruptors (alien laser tech) and gauss guns (alien AP tech) - aliens spawn with them - researchable, manufacturable
flashbangs - explode immediately, no priming, reduces reactions, accuracy and detection radius for 2-3 turns
sped up all projectiles by a factor of 2
heavy weapons will only be issued to soldiers capable of using them (weight > 10, strength > 35)
added police, they will show up as local law enforcement on terror missions and actually fight aliens
incendiary grenades
stun grenades
combat knife
grenade launcher with arcing projectile
flamethrower with area of effect
shotgun with multiple simultaneous projectiles
full automatic fire mode for selected weapons (5 bullet auto fire)
sniper rifle replaces heavy cannon
combat armor added, purchasable from buy interface
power armour replaced with re-coloured TFTD ion armour
flying armour helmet graphics altered
inventory screens for all new/updated armour
left handedness now graphically represented
dual wielding now properly represented on battlescape
soldiers, if issued with pistols, will grab a melee weapon in their left hand, if one is available
