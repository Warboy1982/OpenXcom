code:
mission types: STR_ANTI_INFILTRATION STR_MILITARY_DEFENCE
make terror more likely (1/4 UFOs will instead spawn as terror sites?)
make funding nations much harder to please, make them drop out more often, and when they sign a pact, start generating anti-infiltration missions somewhere in their country (use alien base as a template for how to generate a hidden mission) at a rate of about 1.5 per month, and start generating military defence missions every few weeks or so until all anti-infiltration missions are complete, and set the funding nation to "happy" 
sattelite defense network? - extra base with free planet wide hyper-wave decode, quadruple transit times, no possibility for manufacturing facilities, no hangers. - new map
