hard: involves editing source code:
todo: balancing, check all weapon damage types (grenades especially), play with armour values, fix all sounds and hit types - explosions making sectoid death noise, lol. - frag grenade seems to make 
mission types: STR_ANTI_INFILTRATION STR_MILITARY_DEFENCE
re-implement celatid - no drawing method, projectile stored in pck - use plasma?, silacoid - weird hitbox, fix.
fix AI and melee - not targetting properly, seems to be tracing line of sight to target's feet rather than chest? - make it add target height to check?
finish rank assignments and loadouts for commanders, etc.

done:
all missing alien races re-implemented, including Chryssalids, and their evil powers.
terror missions at military bases (new map type) with military personnel (new unit type) with flashbangs and all mundane weapon types available
plasma blade (alien combat knife), disruptors (alien laser tech) and gauss guns (alien AP tech) - aliens spawn with them - researchable, manufacturable
flashbangs - explode immediately, no priming, reduces reactions, accuracy and detection radius for 2-3 turns
sped up all projectiles by a factor of 2
heavy weapons will only be issued to soldiers capable of using them (weight > 10, strength > 35)
added police, they will show up as local law enforcement on terror missions and actually fight aliens
incendiary grenades
stun grenades
combat knife
grenade launcher with arcing projectile
flamethrower with area of effect
shotgun with multiple simultaneous projectiles
full automatic fire mode for selected weapons (5 bullet auto fire)
sniper rifle replaces heavy cannon
combat armor added, purchasable from buy interface
power armour replaced with re-coloured TFTD ion armour
flying armour helmet graphics altered
inventory screens for all new/updated armour
left handedness now graphically represented
dual wielding now properly represented on battlescape
soldiers, if issued with pistols, will grab a melee weapon in their left hand, if one is available
